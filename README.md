# VolTRE: Volumetry and Uniform Sampling for Timed Regular Expressions

This repository provides the implementation of **VolTRE**, a tool for volumetry and uniform sampling in timed regular expressions (TRE), based on novel methods (to be published).

## Features

- **Uniform Sampling of Timed Words**: Samples timed words of a specified length and duration within a timed regular language, ensuring equal probability for all valid words.
- **Timed Regular Expressions (TRE) Support**: Focuses on uniform sampling exclusively for TRE, addressing a gap in existing research.
- **Exact Duration Control**: Allows sampling with an exact duration, an improvement over prior methods that only controlled expected durations.

More details will be announced.

A selection of experiments can be found in [this folder](./experiments/paper_experiments).

If you want to try our tool, see the [Tutorial JuPyter Notebook](tutorial.ipynb).
