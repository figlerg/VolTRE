# testing the rename operator - TODO I don't know how to handle the renaming... probably just parse it, then before doing anything with it I apply the renaming and treat it as an expression without renaming

{b:c} (<a>_[0,1] + <b>_[0,2])*

# a small mental test - what happens when they are nested?
{b:c} (<a>_[0,1] + <{b:d} b>_[0,2])*
