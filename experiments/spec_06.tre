# TODO trying to reproduce the TAkiller result for simpler expressions. Why is the volume not continuous for n=10 and TAkiller?
# NOTE: this might just be correct... This is very different to the typical smooth examples
# 		- here, we have a smooth thing and smooothen THEN cut it repeatedly, not smoothen a time restricted segment
#<a. <b*>_[0,1]>_[0,2]

# the original spec:
< a.<b.<c.<d*>_[0,1]>_[0,2]>_[0,3]>_[0,4]
